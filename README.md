# Kaggle

## Introduction
This repository contains all the code implementations for different Kaggle competitions. This repository gets gradually updated but is not maintained regularly. Each competition is placed within a separate directory and all the corresponding files of the competition can be found within the respective directory. Most of the directories contain a dataset file as well as a jupyter notebook file that contains the code and all the necessary explanations. This repository is created only for educational purposes and nothing more.

This repository is intended for collaboration between learners. Therefore, feel free to either fork or clone the project and make pull requests. Although not maintained regularly, I will try to watch out for pull requests and handle them.
